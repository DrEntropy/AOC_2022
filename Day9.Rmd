```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
 Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.

If the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough

Otherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up.




## Import and process data
 

```{r}
raw_data <-  read_lines('data/day9_input.txt')
```

## Part 1:

Simulate your complete hypothetical series of motions. How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?
