Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

The data is a list of numbers separated by spaces.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data =  read_delim('data/day1_input.txt',col_names='calories',skip_empty_rows = FALSE, delim=" ")
```

`data$calories` will be NA where  there was a space.  Otherwise a number. 


```{r}
top_three <- data |> mutate(elf_num = cumsum(is.na(calories))) |> 
  filter(! is.na(calories)) |>
  group_by(elf_num) |>
  summarize(total = sum(calories)) |>
  arrange(desc(total)) |> head(3)
top_three
```
```{r}
top_three |> summarise(sum(total))
```
