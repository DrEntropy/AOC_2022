## Advent of Code

This is my first advent of code, and since I am trying to learn R I will be using that language to do the puzzles.

I had to abandon this after day 12 sadly.  I had not realized that the puzzles would require more and more time to complete and I had not budgeted for that amount of time.  Next year I will give it another go, maybe in another language!

This year was not a total bust however, as it did help me improve my R knowledge!
