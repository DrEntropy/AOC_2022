 
## Import and process data
 
First thought is to use rows like this:
Money_num, current_items, operation, operand, test_divisor, true_target, false_target

Then we just process these one at a time, updating the tibble with new current items after each item is processed. Or might be better to keep a seperate list of current items to avoid all the copying?


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data <-  read_delim('data/day11_input.txt',delim = ' ', col_names = c('a', 'b'))
 
```
